# Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express

Node.js and Express are powerful tools for building RESTful APIs, enabling developers to create efficient, scalable backends for web and mobile applications.

## What is a RESTful API?

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

### Steps to Build a RESTful API

1. **Install Node.js and Express**: Begin by installing Node.js and setting up an Express project.

```bash
npm init
npm install express
```

2. **Create Basic Routes**: Define routes for handling different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get("/api/resource", (req, res) => {
  res.send("List of resources");
});

app.post("/api/resource", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Resource created");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

3. **Connect to a Database**: Use MongoDB or any other database to store your data. You can integrate Mongoose to work with MongoDB.

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
mongoose.connect("mongodb: //localhost/mydb", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});
```

4. **Handle Errors and Middleware**: Implement error handling and middleware to ensure your API is secure and robust.

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("Something broke!");
});
```

## Conclusion

Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express is a straightforward and scalable solution for modern web development. With a solid understanding of REST principles and Node.js, you can create APIs that power your applications efficiently.
